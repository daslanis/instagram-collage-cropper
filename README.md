# instagram-collage-cropper
A python script used to crop a square image into a 3 by 3 collage and save them as 9 different images in a folder, mainly written for Instagram posts.

Make sure there is an "input.png" image that has a 1:1 ratio, in the same directory as the python program. After running the script, a "cropped_images" should appear in that directory with 9 different .png images.
